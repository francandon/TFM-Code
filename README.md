# TFM-Code
Code for my TFM in data analysis of X-ray magnetar observation using NuSTAR. It references a python package developed also for this TFM `XTimeAnalysis` which includes the functions used i the analysis notebook. 

In order to compile the code you have to first install all the necessary python packages `astropy`, 'matplotlib', 'scipy' and finally the library `XTimeAnalysis'. For installing the last you must go to the folder XTimeAnalyis in this folder and type in a terminal:

```
pip install .
```

After that you will be able to use this package using import:

```
import XTimeAnalysis as xta
```
